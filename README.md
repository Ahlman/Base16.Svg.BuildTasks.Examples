# Base16.Svg.BuildTasks.Examples

This example solution shows how to use [Base16.Svg.BuildTasks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Base16.Svg.BuildTasks/) for rendering SVG-files in WPF using both .NET Core and .NET Framework.

Note that [Base16.Svg.BuildTasks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Base16.Svg.BuildTasks/) generates `DrawingVisuals` at compile-time so no additional runtime dependencies are required - if you're looking for a solution for opening and drawing SVG-files at runtime then this is not for you.
